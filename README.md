**Synchrotron is no longer in use.** It used to be a bot that would do a few things, most notably post membership and financial stats to Make Salt Lake's leadership team whenever the membership roster changed. Heimdall recently [learned how to do that](https://github.com/makesaltlake/heimdall/commit/ec7d2185a3a05eb01d9f523e6d19d7c188c59567), so Synchrotron is going into retirement. It had a good 4-year run.
